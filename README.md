# Python Custom Streaming Media Player App
### This Custom Streaming Media Player App uses Selenium to webscrape online media players and interact with their respective play and stop buttons to be able to select, play and stop any of the radio stations desired.

### For this project I've opted to scrape the following stations:
* KUSC Classical Music from KUSC.org
* Classical Music from YourClassical.org
* NPR station from RadioStationUSA.fm
* BBC station from RadioStationUSA.fm
* CNN station from RadioStationUSA.fm

### The Custom Streaming Media Player App uses TKinter to create the GUI and includes:
* Play and Stop buttons for each station
* A top file menu with Exit to exit the app
* A Quit Button on the interface to stop the player
